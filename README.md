## Overview

`righthand` acts as your executive second-in-command for multi-agent workflows in [Herdr](https://herdr.dev/) and standalone coding harnesses. It provides a modular persona engine and curated specialist roles designed for autonomous pair-programming, ticket-driven delegation, and workspace isolation across coding harnesses.

Instead of treating an AI agent as a generic monolith, RightHand injects targeted personas via native extensions and hooks across supported harnesses (**Command Code**, **Pi**, **OpenCode**, **Oh My Pi**) or via portable skill standards. Each persona maintains a single perspective, follows rigid output standards, and operates with clear execution boundaries.

### Architectural Principles

- **Single-Perspective Personas**: Each persona embodies a specialized engineering role with a clear evaluation lens, rigid output format, and strict execution boundaries.
- **No Recursive Persona Invocations**: Personas do not invoke other personas at runtime. Multi-agent coordination occurs at the user or orchestrator level across Herdr tabs.
- **Ticket & Worktree Isolation**: Sub-agents communicate through explicit tickets, structured reports, and isolated git worktrees rather than unstructured shared state.
- **Dedicated Harness Folders**: Native extensions and plugins are maintained in clean, harness-specific folders (`.commandcode/`, `.pi/`, `.omp/`, `.opencode/`), backed by a unified CLI and state engine.

## Persona Catalog

The catalog combines developer team roles with Addy Osmani's specialized audit personas (12 personas: 7 `readonly`, 5 `writer`):

| Profile | Mode | Role Title | Core Focus | Output Framework / Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | `readonly` | Team Orchestrator | Decomposing tasks into tickets (`T1`, `T2`), worktree lane assignment, Herdr tab dispatch | Ticket contract matrix, worktree plan, merge checklist |
| `product-manager` | `readonly` | Product Manager | Clarifying ambiguities (min. 2 questions), scoping features, drafting acceptance criteria | Product Spec (Problem statement, User stories, AC, Out-of-scope) |
| `architect` | `readonly` | Software Architect | Module boundaries, coupling reduction, subsystem contracts, tradeoff analysis | Architecture Decision Record (ADR) + System boundary diagram |

## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install globally
npm install -g @agirahman/righthand

# 2. Set up a harness (copies or installs the native integration)
righthand setup cmdc        # Command Code (Linux/macOS: cmd, Windows: cmdc)
righthand setup pi          # Pi Coding Agent
righthand setup omp         # Oh My Pi (copies to .omp/extensions/)
righthand setup opencode    # OpenCode (copies two plugins to .opencode/plugins/)
righthand setup all         # Set up every detected harness at once

# 3. Check health
righthand doctor
```

---

## Unified CLI (`righthand`)

RightHand includes a built-in CLI for managing personas and harness integrations.

```bash
# --- Persona Commands ---
righthand list                   # List all 12 personas + active state
righthand switch backend         # Activate a persona
righthand switch security-auditor
righthand off                    # Deactivate persona (restore default)
righthand inject                 # Print active persona prompt to stdout
righthand status                 # One-liner: active persona + setup harnesses

# --- Setup & Maintenance ---
righthand setup <harness|all>    # Install RightHand into a harness
righthand update [harness]       # Re-sync files for omp/opencode after npm update
righthand doctor                 # Health check: PATH, files, active persona

# --- Info ---
righthand -v / --version         # Print version
righthand -h / --help            # Print help
```

Active persona state is stored in `.righthand/active-persona.json` (per project, gitignored).

## Supported Harnesses & Installation

### 1. Command Code (`.commandcode/`)
RightHand was originally built as a first-class Command Code mod.

- **Install via CLI** (Linux/macOS: `cmd`, Windows: `cmdc` — auto-detected):
  ```bash
  righthand setup cmdc
  # Runs internally: cmdc mods add -g @agirahman/righthand
  ```
- **Slash Commands in session**:
  - `/righthand` or `/profile` — open fuzzy picker or show active persona.
  - `/righthand <persona>` — switch persona on-the-fly.
  - `/righthand off` — restore default prompt.
- **Details**: See [`.commandcode/README.md`](./.commandcode/README.md).

### 2. Pi Coding Agent (`.pi/`)
Pi supports native extensions that hook agent lifecycle events.

- **Install via CLI**:
  ```bash
  righthand setup pi
  # Runs internally: pi install npm:@agirahman/righthand
  ```
- **Slash Command**:
  - `/righthand <persona>` — interactive slash command with full tab-autocomplete for all 12 personas.
  - `/righthand off` — clear persona.
- **Status Indicator**: Displays current persona badge in the Pi UI status bar.
- **Details**: See [`.pi/README.md`](./.pi/README.md).

### 3. Oh My Pi (`.omp/`)
Oh My Pi automatically discovers native extensions placed in `<cwd>/.omp/extensions/`.

- **Setup**:
  ```bash
  righthand setup omp
  # Copies .omp/extensions/righthand.ts into <cwd>/.omp/extensions/
  ```
- **Behavior**: Auto-discovered by OMP runtime without manual plugin trust approval prompts. Hooks `before_agent_start` and registers `/righthand` with interactive picker.
- **Update after npm upgrade**: `righthand update omp`
- **Details**: See [`.omp/README.md`](./.omp/README.md).

### 4. OpenCode (`.opencode/`)
OpenCode uses the native `@opencode/plugin` and `@opencode/plugin/tui` APIs.

- **Setup**:
  ```bash
  righthand setup opencode
  # Copies two plugins into <cwd>/.opencode/plugins/
  ```
- **Two plugins installed**:
  - `righthand-server.js` — injects active persona into system prompt on every session context event (hooks `session.hook("context")`).
  - `righthand-tui.js` — registers native `/righthand` slash command with interactive persona picker, footer status indicator, and toast notifications. State is stored per session in `~/.local/state/opencode/righthand.json`.
- **Slash Command**: `/righthand <persona>` | `/righthand off` | `/righthand list` | `/righthand` (picker)
- **Update after npm upgrade**: `righthand update opencode`
- **Details**: See [`.opencode/README.md`](./.opencode/README.md).

### 5. Cross-Harness Portable Skills (`skills/`)
For harnesses that support portable Agent Skills or custom plugins (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Kimi Code, Cline):

- Persona skills are available under `skills/righthand-<persona>/SKILL.md`.
- Activate by requesting the persona in conversation (e.g., *"Act as righthand-backend"*).
- Compatible plugin manifests are included: `.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.kimi-plugin/`, `.cline-plugin/`, and `.agents/`.

## Herdr Multi-Agent Orchestration

[Herdr](https://herdr.dev/) is an orchestration platform and multi-agent workspace manager that allows developers to run, supervise, and coordinate multiple AI coding agents in parallel tabs across dedicated workspaces.

### Worktree Isolation for Writer Personas

To prevent merge conflicts when multiple agents work simultaneously on the same repository, writer roles (`backend`, `frontend`, `editor`, `devops`, `worker`) must operate in isolated, ticket-prefixed git worktrees:

```bash
# Worktree format: wt/<ticket-id>-<slug>
git worktree add "wt/T1-auth-api" -b "T1-auth-api"
```

Readonly roles (`orchestrator`, `architect`, `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `test-engineer`, `web-performance-auditor`, `product-manager`) inspect the main working tree directly without spawning worktree branches.

### Automated Tab Spawning

Helper scripts automate creating Herdr workspace tabs and provisioning ticket worktrees:

#### PowerShell (`scripts/herdr-spawn.ps1`)
```powershell
.\scripts\herdr-spawn.ps1 -Workspace "w1" -Role "backend" -Ticket "T1" -Description "auth-api"
```

#### POSIX Shell (`scripts/herdr-spawn.sh`)
```bash
./scripts/herdr-spawn.sh w1 backend T1 auth-api
```
